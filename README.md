# 📊 StatMate – Modular Statistical Analyzer in C

**StatMate** is a modular, menu-driven statistical analyzer written in the C programming language.  
It performs core statistical operations like mean, median, mode, variance, and more — all implemented from scratch **without using any built-in math libraries**.

This project was developed as part of my learning journey at **Emertxe Institute of Technology**, where I am currently enhancing my programming and embedded systems skills.

## 🚀 Features

StatMate allows you to:

- ➕ Calculate **Sum** and ✖️ **Product**
- 📊 Find **Average (Mean)**, **Median**, and **Mode**
- 🔼 Identify the **Maximum** and 🔽 **Minimum**
- 🔄 Compute the **Range**
- 📉 Derive **Variance** and 📐 **Standard Deviation**
- 📊 Generate a **Frequency Table**
- 🔍 **Search** for a value in the array
- 🧮 All logic written manually — even square root is implemented without `math.h`

## 🎯 Real-Life Applications

StatMate can be used as a base logic for:

- 📚 Student result data analysis
- 🧾 Business inventory or transaction summary
- 📈 Quick insights from survey or poll responses
- 🧠 Embedded or IoT devices requiring statistical operations in low-resource environments
- 🩺 Health tracking data analysis (like step counts, vitals, etc.)
